      <p>
        Stardew Valley is my favorite video game. It is a very calming and has
        really nice art to look at. The music is also great, and matches the
        vibe of the game very well.

        It has tons of content, keeping you entertained for hours on just one
        game. Due to it being marketed as a farming game, many think that is the
        only thing you can do in Stardew Valley. However, this is incorrect.
        There are aspects of combat, fishing, mining, and more, giving you tons
        of things to do in a day.

        Although the game is relatively pricey at around $15, I believe it is
        more than worth it, as I can gauranteed that you will get more than $15
        worth of content and fun from this game.
